# Hosted Redash SSH Tunnel API

SaaS Redash traffic always arrives from our public IP address: `52.71.84.157`.
We recommend directly whitelisting this address through your firewall.
Alternatively, you can set up an SSH tunnel using the API described below.

# Overview

Two sets of details are needed to connect Redash with your database over SSH:
database access details and SSH access details.

**Database access details** are always entered into Redash directly, regardless
whether an SSH tunnel is required. Any member of the `admin` group can do this
from the **Settings** > **Data Sources** tab. For tunneled connections, the
`host` for your data source will be the private hostname _within_ your
VPC/intranet. Attempts to connect with this data source will fail unless your
firewall allows traffic from our IP or you configure an SSH tunnel.

**SSH access details** are supplied using Redash's REST API because this feature
has not yet been added to our front-end user interface. The tunnel API uses
[public key authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716) to connect with
a bastion server in your network. Once connected to the bastion via SSH, Redash
sends the **database access details** to your database.

For this to work, your bastion host must be exposed over the internet. And you
should add [our public key](https://arikfr.keybase.pub/redash_ssh_key.pub) to
`.ssh/allowed_keys` within the home folder of the system user that Redash will
use to authenticate. We recommend creating a dedicated user for this purpose.

_Note: SSH Connections are ad-hoc. A new connection is tried on each query
execution._

# Setup The Connection

You will need:

a. The address, port, and system user that Redash will use to connect with your
bastion b. The URL for the data source to be tunneled c. The organization slug
for your hosted account d. The API key of an admin user within your organization
(available from the Profile screen)

## Step 1: `GET` the data source details

Copy your organization slug and the numerical data source ID and make an API
call to the `/api/data_sources` endpoint.

`https://app.redash.io/<slug>/api/data_sources/<data source id>`

This request must include an `Authorization` header with a value of
`Key <admin api key>`.

The JSON response includes all the details for the specified data source. Copy
the `name`, `type`, and `options` objects and proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: `POST` the SSH access details

Make a `POST` api call to the same endpoint as step 1 adding an `ssh_tunnel`
object with three key-value-pairs: `ssh_host`, `ssh_port`, and `ssh_username`.
Using the values from **(a)** above. For example:

    {
      "name": "My Sample Database",
      "type": "pg",
      "options": {
        "host": "private.address.in.my.domain.xyz",
        "port": 5432,
        "database": "sampledb",
        "user": "redash-db-user",
        "password": "-------------------",
        "ssh_tunnel": {
          "ssh_username": "redash-tunnel",
          "ssh_port": 22,
          "ssh_host": "bastion.my.domain.xyz"
        }
      }
    }

If you receive an HTTP response with code `200` then your SSH access details
were saved.

## Step 3: Test the connection

You can either visit the data source within Redash and click **Test Connection**
or make a `POST` api call to
`https://app.redash.io/<slug>/api/data_sources/<data source id>/test`.

The JSON response will indicate whether Redash successfully reached your
database through the tunnel
