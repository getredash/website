##  What's Redash?

Redash is designed to enable anyone, regardless of the level of technical sophistication, to harness the power of data big and small. SQL users leverage Redash to explore, query, visualize, and share data from any data sources. Their work in turn enables anybody in their organization to use the data. Every day, millions of users at thousands of organizations around the world use Redash to develop insights and make data-driven decisions.
Redash features:
1. **Browser-based**: Everything in your browser, with a shareable URL.

7. **Alerts**: Define conditions and be alerted instantly when your data changes.
8. **REST API**: Everything that can be done in the UI is also available through REST API.
9. **Broad support for data sources**: Extensible data source API with native support for a long list of common databases and platforms.

## Is Redash compatible with Windows?

As a User, you can use Redash from any operating system with a modern browser
(we recommend Chrome or Firefox). But, if you're looking to run the Open
Source/Self-Hosted version of Redash then for this, you'll need a Linux server
(or a VM/Docker container).

## Browsers Redash Works Best On

We recommend using Chrome or Firefox.

If you encounter any issues that are browser specific, please let us know.
