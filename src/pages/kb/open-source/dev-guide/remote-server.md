If you want to work only on the frontend side of Redash, and have a Redash instance
deployed already (running version 1.0.0 or newer), you can use this instance as
your API server and run locally only the webpack dev-server.

The setup in this case is very simple:

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (14.16.1 or newer, can be installed with Homebrew on OS/X)
2. Install Yarn (1.22.10 or newer): `npm install --global yarn@1.22.10`
3. Git clone the repository.
4. Change to the repository directory, and install Node packages: `yarn --frozen-lockfile`.
5. Start webpack dev-server: `REDASH_BACKEND="URL of your redash server" yarn start`.

The `REDASH_BACKEND=""` part of the command sets the URL of your remote Redash server.
