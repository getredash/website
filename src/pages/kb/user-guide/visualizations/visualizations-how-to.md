## Create a New Visualization

Once your query has finished running for the first time, you can add a
visualization by clicking the “New Visualization” button above the results
table.

## Edit A Visualization

You can modify the settings of an existing visualization from the query editor
screen. Click the visualization on the tab bar and you'll see an
`Edit Visualization` option beneath each visualization. Clicking it will open
the current settings for that visualization (type, X axis, Y axis, groupings
etc.). Hit "Save" to apply your changes or "Cancel" to leave no trace.

## Embedding Visualizations

It's easy to embed Redash visualizations. Just click the elipsis button beneath
any visualization to show further options and select `Embed Elsewhere`.

This will pop up the `<iframe>` code you can drop into your HTML pages.

{% callout warning %} Queries with text-type parameters do not support embeds.
{% endcallout %}

For SaaS customers, there is also a hardlink to a PNG of your visualization
hosted through `snap.redash.io`. The PNG embed is especially useful in contexts
where iframes won't work (like GitHub issues). If you need the visualization PNG
to include a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header, just tack the Query String
variable `?no-cache` to the end of your PNG embed link.

### Query String Variables for Embeds

You can append query string variables to your embed URLs:

- `?hide_parameters` hides any parameter selection widgets
- `?hide_header` hides the branded Redash header and query title
- `?hide_link` hides the link back to Redash
- `?hide_timestamp` hides the timestamp

### Downloading A Visualization as an Image File

For chart visualizations, you can also download a local image file. Just hover
your mouse near the top right area of the visualization and click the camera
icon that appears. A PNG will be downloaded to your device.
