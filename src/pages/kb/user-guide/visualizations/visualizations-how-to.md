## Create a New Visualization

Once your query has finished running for the first time, you can add a visualization by clicking the “New Visualization” button above the results table.

## Edit A Visualization

You can modify the settings of an existing visualization from the query editor screen. Click the visualization on the tab bar and you'll see an `Edit Visualization` option beneath each visualization. Clicking it will open the current settings for that visualization (type, X axis, Y axis, groupings etc.). Hit "Save" to apply your changes or "Cancel" to leave no trace.

## Embedding Visualizations

It's easy to embed Redash visualizations. Just click the elipsis button beneath any visualization to show further options and select `Embed Elsewhere`.

This will pop up the `<iframe>` code you can drop into your HTML pages.

{% callout warning %}
Queries with parameters do not support embeds at the moment.
{% endcallout %}

For SaaS customers, there is also a hardlink to a PNG of your visualization hosted through `snap.redash.io`. The PNG embed is especially useful in contexts where iframes won't work (like GitHub issues). 

If you need the visualization PNG to include a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header, just tack the Query String variable `?no-cache` to the end of your PNG embed link.

### Downloading A Visualization as an Image File

For chart visualizations, you can also download a local image file. Just hover your mouse near the top right area of the visualization and click the camera icon that appears. A PNG will be downloaded to your device.
