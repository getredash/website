## API Authentication

All the API calls support authentication with an API key. Redash has two types
of API keys:

- User API Key: has the same permissions as the user who owns it. Can be found
  on a user profile page.
- Query API Key: has access only to the query and its results. Can be found on
  the query page.

Whenever possible we recommend using a Query API key.

## Accessing with Python

We provide a light wrapper around the Redash API called `redash-toolbelt`. The
source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/getredash/redash-toolbelt).
The `examples` folder in that repo includes useful demos, such as:

- [Poll for Fresh Query Results (including parameters)](https://github.com/getredash/redash-toolbelt/blob/master/redash_toolbelt/examples/refresh_query.py)
- [Refresh an entire Dashboard](https://github.com/getredash/redash-toolbelt/blob/master/redash_toolbelt/examples/refresh_dashboard.py)
- [Export all your queries as files](https://github.com/getredash/redash-toolbelt/blob/master/redash_toolbelt/examples/query_export.py)

## Common Endpoints

{% callout danger %} Below is an incomplete list of Redash's API endpoints as of
V9. These may change in future versions of Redash. {% endcallout %}

Each endpoint is appended to your Redash base URL. For example:

- `app.redash.io/<slug>/api`
- `redash.example.com/api`

### Queries

`/api/queries`

- GET: Returns a paginated array of query objects. - Includes the most recent
  `query_result_id` for non-parameterized queries.
- POST: Create a new query object

`/api/queries/<id>`

- GET: Returns an individual query object
- POST: Edit an existing query object.
- DELETE: Archive this query.

`/api/queries/<id>/results`

- POST: Refreshes a query and responds with a query task result (job). - If your
  request JSON includes a `max_age` key (integer value in seconds), a cached
  result will be provided if one is available. - If passing parameters, they
  must be included in the JSON request body as a `parameters` object.

{% callout info %}

Here's an example JSON object including different parameter types:

```
{
    "parameters": {
    	"number_param": 100,
    	"date_param": "2020-01-01",
    	"date_range_param": {
    		"start": "2020-01-01",
    		"end": "2020-12-31"
    		}
    	}
    }
```

{% endcallout %}

`/api/jobs/<job_id>`

- GET: Returns a query task result (job) + Possible statuses: - 1 == PENDING
  (waiting to be executed) - 2 == STARTED (executing) - 3 == SUCCESS - 4 ==
  FAILURE - 5 == CANCELLED + When status is success, the job will include a
  `query_result_id`

`/api/query_results/<query_result_id>`

- GET: Returns a query result - Appending a filetype of `.csv` or `.json` to
  this request will return a downloadable file. If you append your `api_key` in
  the query string, this link will work for non-logged-in users.

### Dashboards

`/api/dashboards`

- GET: Returns a paginated array of dashboard objects.
- POST: Create a new dashboard object

`/api/dashboards/<dashboard_slug>`

- GET: Returns an individual dashboard object.

`/api/dashboards/<dashboard_id>`

- POST: Edit an existing dashboard object.
- DELETE: Archive this dashboard
