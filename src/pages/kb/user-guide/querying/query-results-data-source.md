The **Query Results Data Source** (QRDS) lets you run queries against results from your other Data Sources. Use it to join data from multiple databases or perform post-processing. Redash uses an in-memory SQLite database to make this possible. As a result, queries against large result sets may fail if Redash runs out of memory. 

{% callout warning %}

The QRDS doesn't work with results from queries that use [parameters](/help/user-guide/querying/query-parameters). If you try it you'll see `Error running query: Failed loading results from query id xxxx`. Remove the parameters from `query_xxxx` to fix the error.

{% endcallout %}

### Setup
You can enable **Query Results** under the `Data Source` tab of the settings menu. Setup is easy: just provide a name for the source. This is the name that will appear in the source dropdown of the query editor.

### Querying
The QRDS accepts [SQLite query syntax](https://sqlite.org/lang.html):

```
SELECT
	a.name,
	b.count 
FROM query_123 AS a 
JOIN query_456 AS b
  		ON a.id = b.id
```

Your other queries are like "tables" to the QRDS. Each one is aliased as `query_` followed by its `query_id` which you can see in the URL bar of your browser from the query editor. For example, a query at `/queries/49588` has the alias `query_49588`.

{% callout warning %}
The query alias like `query_49588` _must_ appear on the same line as its associated `FROM` or `JOIN` keyword.
{% endcallout %}

### Cached Query Results
When you query the **Query Results Data Source**, Redash executes the underlying queries first. This guarantees recent results in case you [schedule a QRDS query](/help/user-guide/querying/scheduling-a-query). You can speed up QRDS queries by using `cached_query_` for your query aliases instead of `query_`. This tells Redash to use the cached results from the most recent execution of a given query. This improves performance by using older data. You can mix both syntaxes in the same query too:

```
SELECT
	a.name,
	b.count 
FROM cached_query_123 AS a 
JOIN query_456 AS b
  		ON a.id = b.id
```

### Query Results Permissions
Access to the **Query Results Data Source** is governed by the groups it's associated with [like any other Data Source](/help/user-guide/users/permissions-groups). But Redash will also check if a user has permission to execute queries on the Data Sources the original queries use.

As an example, a user with access to the QRDS cannot execute `SELECT * FROM query_123` if query `123` uses a data source to which that user does not have access. They will see the most recently cached QRDS query result from the query screen in Redash. But they will not be able to execute the query again.
