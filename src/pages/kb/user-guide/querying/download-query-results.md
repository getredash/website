The download dataset buttons point to the current query result you see on screen. To get a URL which always points at the latest query results, click on the "Show API Key" button in the query menu.

{% callout info %}

The latest results API is not supported for queries that use parameters.

{% endcallout %}

In the dialog that will open you will find the Query API key and links to the latest results URL in CSV and JSON format. You can also get the Excel format by changing the file type suffix from `json`/`csv` to `xlsx`.
