The Download Dataset URLs are direct links to the current query result you see
on screen. To get a URL which always points at the latest query results, click
on the "Show API Key" button in the query menu.

In the dialog that will open you will find:

- Query API key.
- Latest results URL in CSV and JSON format. You can also get the Excel format by changing the file type suffix from `json`/`csv` to `xlsx`.

{% callout info %}

The latest results in CSV or JSON format option will not work for queries that use parameters.

{% endcallout %}
