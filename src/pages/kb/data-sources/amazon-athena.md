The first thing you'll need to do is create an IAM user that will have
permissions to run queries with Amazon Athena and access the S3 buckets that
contain your data.

## Create IAM Policy

The policy should allow access to your S3 bucket

1. Sign in to the IAM console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Policies, and then Create Policy.

In the policy body, you can use a policy similar to:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Don't forget to change `my-bucket` to your bucket name. You can list several
buckets, but please note that we have separate permissions for the bucket (
`arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket`) and the objects (`arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*`).

## Create IAM User

- Sign in to the IAM console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/>.
- In the navigation pane, choose Users, and then Add User.
- Enter the desired User Name.
- Check the checkbox next to Programmatic Access and then click Next.

- In the Permissions step, select Attach existing policies directly and attach
  the AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess policy along with the one to access S3 buckets
  you created previously.

- Click Next, then review all the details and Create User.
- Take note of the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

## Create Athena Data Source

In Redash, in the New Data Source page select "Athena" as the data source type
and fill out the details using the information from the previous step:

- **AWS Access Key** and **AWS Secret Key** are the ones from the previous step.
- **AWS Region** is the region where you use Amazon Athena.
- **S3 Staging Path** is the bucket Amazon Athena uses for staging/query
  results, you might have created it already if you used Amazon Athena from AWS
  console - simply copy the same path.

If you have trouble refreshing the Athena data source schema, check whether
you're using
[AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/glue-athena.html). If so
you should toggle **Use Glue Data Catalog** under the Additional Settings menu.

{% endcallout %}

## Troubleshooting

If you're getting an error message saying: **"Insufficient permissions to
execute the query."**, then make sure that you gave permissions to the IAM user
to access the S3 bucket where the data is stored.

### AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess

When using Athena you need the following S3 permissions:

- Read permissions for the buckets you query from.
- Write permissions for the Query Results bucket.

The latter is supposed to be covered by the _AWSQuicksightAthenaAccess_ policy,
but it defines this only for the following buckets:
`arn:aws:s3:::aws-athena-query-results-*` .

If you use a different bucket location, you need to specify it in your custom
policy. The required permissions for the query results bucket are:

                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:CreateBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
