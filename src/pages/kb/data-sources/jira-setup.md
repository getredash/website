You need a **Username** and **[API Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)** to connect to Jira. The token behaves like a password. 

{% callout warning %}

Before Redash V8 the JIRA setup screen asked for a password. You still need an API token to connect successfully. Use your API token instead of your password.

{% endcallout %}
