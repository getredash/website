## Setup

Redash connects to CloudWatch using the `boto3` client. According to their
[documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html)
before you can query with Redash...

> [Y]ou should set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS
> account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing
> user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new set of keys.

With your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` you can set up the CloudWatch
and CloudWatch Log Insights data sources.

## Querying CloudWatch

These instructions assume you are familiar with the CloudWatch ad-hoc query
language. To make exploring your data easier the schema browser will show which
**Namespaces** and **Metrics** you can query.

![CloudWatch Schema Example](/assets/images/docs/gitbook/cloudwatch-schema.png)

Your query text must written in [YAML syntax](https://yaml.org/start.html) (not
SQL). It should be an array of `MetricDataQuery` objects under a key called
`MetricsDataQueries`. When you execute the query Redash converts this array to
one or more `get_metric_data()` calls.

Here's an example that sends two `MetricDataQuery` objects.

```yaml
MetricDataQueries:
  - Id: database_connections
    MetricStat:
      Metric:
        Namespace: AWS/RDS
        MetricName: DatabaseConnections
      Period: 60
      Stat: Maximum
  - Id: swap_usage
    MetricStat:
      Metric:
        Namespace: AWS/RDS
        MetricName: SwapUsage
      Period: 60
      Stat: Maximum
StartTime: '2020-01-01 00:00:00'
```

{% callout info %} To query your CloudWatch data with SQL, first pull data using
the YAML syntax. Then use QRDS to filter and sort the results {% endcallout %}

## Querying CloudWatch Logs Insights

These instructions assume you are familiar with the CloudWatch Logs Insights
ad-hoc query language. To make exploring your data easier the schema browser
will show which **Log Groups** and **@Fields** you can query. Your query text
must be written in [YAML Syntax]() (not SQL). Your query can include the
following keys:

| Key             | Type                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `logGroupName`  | string                |
| `logGroupNames` | array of strings      |
| `startTime`     | integer or timestring |
| `endTime`       | integer or timestring |
| `queryString`   | string                |
| `limit`         | integer               |

Your query _must_ include either a `logGroupName` or `logGroupNames`. When you
execute the query Redash converts this object into a `start_query()` call. Here
is an example query:

```
startTime: '2020-01-01 00:00'
logGroupNames: ['/ecs/rq-adhoc', '/ecs/rq-scheduled', '/ecs/rq-workers-scheduled']
queryString:
  filter @message like 'Opened tunnel for <some org id>'
  | parse 'Opened tunnel for <some org id> (<data source id>) with port *' as port
  | fields @timestamp, @logStream
  | sort @timestamp desc
```
