## Setup

Redash connects to CloudWatch using the `boto3` client. According to their [documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html) before you can query with Redash...

> [Y]ou should set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new set of keys.

With your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` you can set up the CloudWatch and CloudWatch Log Insights data sources.

## Querying CloudWatch

These instructions assume you are familiar with the CloudWatch ad-hoc query language. To make exploring your data easier the schema browser will show which **Namespaces** and **Metrics** you can query.

![CloudWatch Schema Example](/assets/images/docs/gitbook/cloudwatch-schema.png)

Your query text must written in [YAML syntax](https://yaml.org/start.html) (not SQL). It should be an array of `MetricDataQuery` objects under a key called `MetricsDataQueries`. When you execute the query Redash converts this array to one or more `get_metric_data()` calls.

Here's an example that sends two `MetricDataQuery` objects.

```yaml
MetricDataQueries:
  - Id: database_connections
    MetricStat:
      Metric:
        Namespace: AWS/RDS
        MetricName: DatabaseConnections
      Period: 60
      Stat: Maximum
  - Id: swap_usage
    MetricStat:
      Metric:
        Namespace: AWS/RDS
        MetricName: SwapUsage
      Period: 60
      Stat: Maximum
StartTime: '2020-01-01 00:00:00'
```

To query your CloudWatch data with SQL, first pull data using the YAML syntax. Then use QRDS to filter and sort the results

## Querying CloudWatch Logs Insights

These instructions assume you are familiar with the CloudWatch Logs Insights ad-hoc query language. To make exploring your data easier the schema browser will show which **Log Groups** and **@Fields** you can query. Your query text must be written in [YAML Syntax]() (not SQL). Your query can include the following keys:

| Key             | Type                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `logGroupName`  | string                |
| `logGroupNames` | array of strings      |
| `startTime`     | integer or timestring |
| `endTime`       | integer or timestring |
| `queryString`   | string                |
| `limit`         | integer               |

Your query _must_ include either a `logGroupName` or `logGroupNames`. When you execute the query Redash converts this object into a `start_query()` call. Here is an example query:

```
startTime: '2020-01-01 00:00'
logGroupNames: ['/ecs/rq-adhoc', '/ecs/rq-scheduled', '/ecs/rq-workers-scheduled']
queryString:
  filter @message like 'Opened tunnel for <some org id>'
  | parse 'Opened tunnel for <some org id> (<data source id>) with port *' as port
  | fields @timestamp, @logStream
  | sort @timestamp desc
```
