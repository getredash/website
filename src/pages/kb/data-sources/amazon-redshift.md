## How to Configure Security Groups

1. Begin at the Amazon Redshift console navigation pane. Choose **Clusters**.
2. Open your cluster to the **Configuration** tab.
3. Under _Cluster Properties_ â†’ _VPC Security Groups_ choose your security group. It will open in the Amazon EC2 console.

If you are using hosted Redash click **Edit** and

- For **Type** choose `Custom TCP Rule`
- For **Protocol** choose `TCP`
- For **Port Range** type the same port number that you used when you launched the cluster. The default port for Amazon Redshift is `5439`. Yours may be different.
- For **Source** pick `Custom IP` and type `52.71.84.157/32`. This is our public IP address.
- Click **Save**
