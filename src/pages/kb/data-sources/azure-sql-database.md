When entering the username you need to make sure it's of the form: `user@server-name`. Where `server-name` is your server address without the `.database-windows.net` suffix.

Check out [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/create-data-warehouse-portal#create-a-server-level-firewall-rule) for instructions to whitelist your Redash IP address when connecting to Synapse.
