# Redash Website and Knowledge Base

We use Gatsby as our static site generator. The website is built and hosted with Netlify.

## Updating contributors data file

```
npm run fetch-contributors > website/_data/contributors.json
```

## Website development

`yarn run develop` will start Gatsby in development mode and serve the the website on `http://localhost:8000/`.
