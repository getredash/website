## Installing Dependencies

### PostgreSQL & Redis

Refer to the documentation of Python (2.7), PostgreSQL (9.3 or newer), Redis (2.8.3 or newer) and Node.js (v6 or newer) on how to install them in your environment. On macOS, you can use `brew` to install them. On Linux you can use your package manager, although need to make sure it installs recent enough versions.

### Python Packages

For development the minimum required packages to install are described in:

* requirements.txt
* requirements_dev.txt

You install them with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_dev.txt
```

(We recommend installing them in a virtualenv. For using some data source types, you need to install additional dependencies from requirements_all_ds.txt.)

### Node.js Packages

Install all packages with:

```bash
npm install
```

First time build assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

For development, in most cases the default configuration is enough. But if you need
to adjust the database configuration, mail settings or any [other setting](../setup/settings-environment-variables.md),
you do so with environment variables.

To avoid having to export those variables manually, you can use a `.env` file and
the `bin/run` helper script. By invoking any command with `bin/run` prefix, it will
load your environment variables from the `.env` file and then run your command. For
example:

```bash
bin/run ./manage.py check_settings
```

## Creating Database Tables

```bash
bin/run ./manage.py database create_tables
```

## Processes

The main Redash processes you have to run:

* Web server
* Celery worker(s) & scheduler

In development you will also run Webpack's dev server or watch utility.

Our recommendation:

* Web server: `bin/run ./manage.py runserver --debugger --reload`
* Celery: `./bin/run celery worker --app=redash.worker --beat -Qscheduled_queries,queries,celery -c2`
* Webpack dev server: `npm run start`

This will result in a Flask web server listening on port `5000`, Webpack dev server
on port `8080` and 2 Celery workers ready to run queries.

To open the app in your web browser, use Webpack's dev server -- `localhost:8080`,
which will auto reload and refresh whenever you make changes to the frontend code.

## Running Tests

Currently we currently have tests only for the backend code. To run them invoke:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
