If you login to Redash with a Google account, Redash will automatically fetch your Google Account profile picture. Alternatively, Redash uses [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) to handle profile pictures.

Sign up for Gravatar with the email address you used to sign-in to Redash. Your Gravatar will appear on Redash within 5 minutes.

You may need to clear your browser's cache to make your Gravatar appear.
