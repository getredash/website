If you login to Redash with a Google account, Redash will automatically fetch your Google Account profile picture. Alternatively, Redash uses [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) to handle profile pictures.

Sign up for Gravatar with the email address you used to sign-in to Redash. When you're finished making your Gravatar, log out of Redash and then log back in. Your profile picture will automatically appear.

You may need to clear your browser's cache to make your Gravatar appear. Here are instructions for doing this in [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache) and [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9098093?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&hl=en&visit_id=636798707554756399-1332870103&rd=1).
