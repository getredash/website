Cohorts are a good tool to review retention of users over a defined period of
time.

To create your own cohort report, you'll need to define your cohort time
frame, population, and activeness of users.

Here is an example of a cohort query in PostgreSQL, step by step:


{% callout %}
We used the `WITH` clause in this example - `WITH` clauses allow you to name a sub-query block, this way your query is modular (and sometimes runs faster), it can later be referred in the main query instead of making a large main query with many aliases, `JOIN`s or other complexities. You can have multiple sub-queries, just be sure to have a comma between them.
{% endcallout %}

1. Select the time frame you want to investigate (usually a between a week and a month)  
    
    ```
    WITH    
    time_frame AS (    
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE - 14   
    ),
    ```

2. Define your population relative to the cohort date, for each following day 
    
    ```
    population AS (
      SELECT created_at::DATE AS cohort_date, id AS unique_id
      FROM users
      WHERE created_at > (SELECT * FROM time_frame)
    ),
    ```

3. Define what's an active user to you - what event interest you to examine 

    ```    
    activity AS (
      SELECT created_at::DATE AS activity_date, org_id AS unique_id, cohort_date
      FROM events
      JOIN population ON population.unique_id = org_id
      WHERE created_at > (SELECT * FROM time_frame)
    ),
    ```
    

4. Aggregate your population by cohort date (day 1, day 2...) 
    
    ``` 
    population_agg AS (
      SELECT cohort_date, COUNT(distinct unique_id) AS total
      FROM population
      GROUP BY 1
    )
    ```

5. Write your query to show your population % by cohort dates 
    
    ```
    SELECT activity.cohort_date AS DATE,
           date_part('day',age(activity_date, activity.cohort_date)) AS day_number,
           COUNT(distinct unique_id) AS value,
           total
    FROM activity
    JOIN population_agg ON activity.cohort_date = population_agg.cohort_date
    GROUP BY 1, 2, 4
    ```

6. Add a cohort visualization to your query and you're done!
