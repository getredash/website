title: Adding Tags to Queries
slug: adding-tags

Somewhere in the middle between naming queries with long-tediou-very
descriptive names and having fancy clickable tags you can use #tags! Add a
`#marketing`, `#devops` or `#xmas-sales` "tag" to your query names and then
search for all queries with that #tag.

Same goes for Dashboards (although you can already group them by topics when
using the prefix convention, read more [here](http://help.redash.io/article/63
-grouping-dashboards)).
