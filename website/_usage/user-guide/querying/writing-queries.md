To start working on a new query, click "New Query" on the home page or under
the Queries menu in the navigation bar.

###  Publish/Unpublish

By default each query starts in a draft state (Unpublished), which means that:

  * Only the user who created this query can see it in the "All Queries" list or in search results.
  * You can't add visualizations from an unpublished query to dashboards or use it in alerts.

To publish a query you can simply give it a name or click the "Publish"
button. It's also possible to unpublish a published query by clicking on the
"Unpublish" button in the query menu.

### Query Syntax

In most cases we use the data sources native query language. In some cases
there are differences or additions, which are documented in the [Querying Data
Sources category]({% link _usage/data-sources/querying_category.md %}).

### Schema Browser and Autocomplete

To the left of the query editor, you will find the Schema Browser:

![](http://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5877897f90336009736c5d9b/images/5a42799e0428631938004ad7/file-qJlSAp0sl0.png)

The schema browser will list all your tables, and when clicking on a table
will show its columns. You can filter the schema with the search box and
refresh it by clicking on the refresh button (otherwise it refreshes
periodically in the background).

{% callout %}
Please note that not all data source types support loading the schema.
{% endcallout %}

Beside the schema browser, Redash supports autocomplete while typing your
query. The autocomplete is auto triggered, unless you have a large schema
(>5000 tokens - tables and columns). In case of a large schema, the
autocomplete can be manually triggered with `Ctrl` \+ `Space`.

### Keyboard Shorcuts

  * Execute query: `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Enter`
  * Save query: `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `S`

## Additional Query Actions

### Archiving a Query

Once a query is no longer useful, you can archive it. Archiving is almost the
same as deleting, except that direct links to the query will still work. To
archive a query, open the little menu at the top-right area of the query
editor, next to the Save button and click Archive.

### Duplicating (Forking) a Query

If you need to create a copy of an existing query (created by you or someone
else), you can fork it. To fork a query, just click on the Fork button (see
example below)
