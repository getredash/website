## Creating a Dashbaord

A dashboard is defined as a combination of visualizations and text boxes. Want

You can add a new dashboard via the Dashboard menu (the last item will be New
Dashboard) or via the home screen:

After naming your dashboard, you can start adding widgets to it from existing
query visualizations or create different commentary texts.

Select an existing query or add a text, you can select between 2 sizes -
regular (half screen width) or double (full screen width).

## Adding Visualizations

Dashboards aggregate multiple query datasets, visualizations, and texts into
one handy view.

To add widgets to a dashboard, select the query you want to feature and the
relevant visualization. By default, query results are shown in a table.

At the moment it's not possible to create a new visualization from the "Add
Widget" menu, so you'll need to open the query and add the visualization there
beforehand ([instructions]({% link _usage/user-guide/visualizations/visualizations-how-to.md %})).

## Dashboard Filters

When queries have filters you need to apply filters at the dashboard level as
well. Setting your dashboard filters flag will cause the filter to be applied
to all Queries.

1\. Open dashboard settings:
