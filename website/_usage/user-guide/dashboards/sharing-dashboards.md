## Embedding Dashboards

To embed a dashboard, you can use the full screen URL of a dashboard (click on the full screen button). This will require users to be logged-in to Redash. To embed Redash for external users, see **Sharing Dashboards** below.

## Sharing Dashboards

You can share any existing dashboard with external users (they'll only see the
widgets, so no navigation and other buttons you see in the Redash app).

To share a dashboard, toggle the share URL and send the secret link that gets
generated:
