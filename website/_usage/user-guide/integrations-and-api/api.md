## API Authentication

All the API calls support authentication with an API key. Redash has two types
of API keys:

  * User API Key: has the same permissions as the user who owns it. Can be found on a user profile page.
  * Query API Key: has access only to the query and its results. Can be found on the query page.

Whenever possible we recommend using a Query API key.

## API Usage Examples

Below you can find a few example scripts that use our API for various tasks:

### Export All Your Queries as Files

Given an API key, it will export all the account queries as simple files on
your file system. Can be useful for backups or to sync a git repository.

### Poll for Fresh Query Results (including parameters)

<https://gist.github.com/arikfr/e3e434d8cfd7f331d499ccf351abbff9>

This example uses the refresh API to make Redash refresh a query to make sure
you get fresh results and then poll the API until a result is ready. Can be
used for queries with or without parameters.
