To load a CSV file from a URL, you use the CSV file address as the query text
(i.e. https://example.com/file.csv ). Redash expects a CSV file with a header
as the first row.

To further filter or manipulate the data you can use the [Query Results data
source]({% link _usage/user-guide/querying/query-results-data-source.md %}).
