When connecting to DynamoDB we use a library named DQL to parse your queries
into DynamoDB API calls. To learn more about how to write DQL queries, you can
check [their
documentation](https://dql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/queries/select.html).

 **"No index found for query. Please use a SCAN query, or set
allow_select_scan=True opt allow_select_scan true" Error Message**

In case you receive the above error message, you need to replace SELECT in
your query with SCAN.
